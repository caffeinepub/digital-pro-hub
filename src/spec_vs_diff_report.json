The page includes the required dropdown labels/options and uses a centralized pricing matrix helper. Some acceptance-criteria items (note text, neutral placeholder state, and WhatsApp button target/rel) cannot be fully verified due to truncation of the new page file in the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "If one or both dropdowns are not selected yet, the price area shows a neutral placeholder state (no estimate).",
      "reason": "The InstantPriceCalculator.tsx diff is truncated right as the price display section begins, so the placeholder/empty-state behavior cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
